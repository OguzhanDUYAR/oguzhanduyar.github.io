              >My interest in technology started when I was very young. As a child, I have disassembled a lot of electronics from various type devices in the range  a vacuum cleaner to a radio. Naturally, my family's reaction was quite harsh to this. Of course, my family reacted very harshly to this. My adventure started with playstation 1 when I was 3-4 years old. It was the first electronic device I used. At that time, there was no such thing as an original game in Turkey, the year was 2000-2002. In pirate game shops, we would first select the game from a catalog and then wait for the game to be copied on the PC. Those PCs would have 5-6 CD burners. When I saw that device, I fell in love. It was a great machine. Owning a PC in Turkey back then was a difficult thing. I insisted, but my parents didn't take it. To them, the PC was an expensive toy. A few years later my parents agreed to buy a PC. The brand of my first computer was OLIVETTİ. He doesn't remember his processor, but he had a 256 MB ram 20 GB hard disk. It came with the Windows 2000 operating system. Now I had a computer but no internet. I even had a hard time getting the computer. There was GTA III and ninja turtles game. Everything was perfect. GTA San Andreas was released in 2004. Everyone went crazy, of course I wanted it too. A pirated copy of the game had arrived at an internet cafe. I had the game installed on my computer at a good price back then. Back then I had 512 MB of ram but it wasn't enough. In those years, computer speeds were measured by GTA San Andreas runtime and loading time. It was usually installed with 5-6 CDs. I had a hard time with 512 MB of ram and Windows XP. It's very stupid, but we used to even believe that applying vaseline to the pc inputs accelerates the pc. While researching ways to speed up Windows XP, I learned a lot about computers. Pirated gaming on Windows XP came at a price, VIRUSES. Constantly XP would crash and we would have to reinstall it. The first formats were made by a computer guy for money. Once upon a time my family was tired of giving money. I learned to install windows and install drivers myself. In 2006-2007, my family had internet connected with a quota (Limit is 5 GB). When the limit was exceeded, the bill was too high. My family regretted connecting to the internet and they canceled the subscription. Back then Mynet, Facebook, MSN, Yahoo and mIRC were legendary stuff. I was doomed to internet cafes for the internet. But I would bring a USB disk with me and copy the game. I used to rent movie CDs and copy them on the computer. At that time, the Pirate was neither original nor anyone knows. In 2008, I saw the Mac os X operating system in a movie. I noticed that there are operating systems other than Windows. I started researching in the internet cafe.</p

                    While researching, I came across a linux distribution developed in Turkey. Its name was Pardus, it has been under development since 2003. I really liked it. I went to the internet cafe and downloaded the CD image. I burned a CD and installed it on my computer. There were too many problems. Everything was different and the KDE desktop environment was very different from windows XP. Even understanding the driver issue and how to install the software was a big question. There was no information about playing the game. Even for MP3 files it was necessary to install codecs. As a result of my research, I found a way to install software, COMPILING the source codes. Of course, at that time, I did not know the terms such as compilation, coding, libraries. Someone who saw me doing research on Linux mentioned package systems in Linux. The problem was I didn't have internet. Even when compiling Satin, I could not compile many software due to lack of library. It was completely my ignorance. I hugged the computer case and went to the internet cafe. It was very difficult to convince the owner of the internet cafe. Pardus was also using the Pisi Package System developed in Turkey (current Pisi Linux). I installed as many packages as I could, which of course caused the system to be unstable. Years later (around 2011) I combined the internet and linux duo. I was very happy.

                <p>
                  The main tools of a bioinformatician are computer software programs and the internet. A fundamental activity is sequence analysis of DNA and proteins using various programs and databases available on the world wide web. Anyone, from clinicians to molecular biologists, with access to the internet and relevant websites can now freely discover the composition of biological molecules such as nucleic acids and proteins by using basic bioinformatic tools. This does not imply that handling and analysis of raw genomic data can easily be carried out by all. Bioinformatics is an evolving discipline, and expert bioinformaticians now use complex software programs for retrieving, sorting out, analysing, predicting, and storing DNA and protein sequence data.
